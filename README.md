# DES
The project involves the implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm on an 8051 microcontroller for secure data encryption and decryption in embedded systems. DES, though considered outdated for modern applications due to its susceptibility to brute-force attacks, serves as an educational and historical reference. The project aims to demonstrate the adaptability of cryptographic algorithms to constrained environments like the 8051 microcontroller, addressing challenges such as limited memory, processing power, and unique architectural characteristics.
